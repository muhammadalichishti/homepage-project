# My Vision

Originally, this project began as part of my coursework for the Odin Project. Over time, it evolved into a broader initiative: each year, I plan to create a website that captures my vision for that year. It's been an enjoyable and fulfilling journey, and I eagerly anticipate the development of Vision 2025 next year.
